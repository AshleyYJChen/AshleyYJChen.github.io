                    <p><b>Hoopers is a web based application created by a team of three for a class project in UC San Diego. I experienced the flow of user interaction design and utilized programming skills for routing and front-end engineering. 
                        The app Hoopers tackles the issue of finding pick-up basketball games and also allows players to track their game performance. It is a combination of needfinding and a dash of fun that led us to this app idea, as we initially bonded over chatting about basketball.</p>

We asked our target audience, recreational basketball players, what is appealing about basketball and how they go about finding basketball games. We also interviewed other people to gauge their level of interest in basketball and to possibly see what is holding them back from playing more.
